/**
 * Proxy for a generated asset name.
 *
 * Asset names are generated from the raw asset paths (the "inputs"). Inputs
 * can have several forms:
 *
 *  * absolute file system paths
 *  * file system paths relative to one of a few predefined root directories
 *  * absolute Puli paths
 *  * Puli paths relative to the Puli directory of the loaded Twig template
 *  * ...
 *
 * We want to make sure that assets corresponding to the same file on the file
 * system receive the same generated name, regardless of whether they are
 * referred to by an absolute or a relative, by a Puli or by a file system path.
 * Therefore we need to delay the generation of the name until the following
 * information is known:
 *
 *  * the predefined root directories
 *  * the current Puli directory
 *
 * The root directories are static. The Puli directory, however, depends on the
 * loaded Twig template. Hence this class delays the name generation until the
 * method {@link setCurrentDir()} was called.
